 Bad Habit Tracker

## Project Description
The **Bad Habit Tracker** is a personal productivity and wellness web app built with Django 
that helps users **identify, track, and replace bad habits** with positive alternatives.  
It allows users to log habits, reflect through journals, set reminders, monitor frequency and 
progress, create replacement plans, earn achievements, share progress, and view analytical reports 
over time, as they make progress toward a healthier lifestyle.
