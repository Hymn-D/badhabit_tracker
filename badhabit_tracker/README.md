# Bad Habit Tracker API

## Project Description

The **Bad Habit Tracker API** is a Django REST Framework‚Äìbased backend system that helps users identify, track, and replace bad habits.  
It allows users to log their habits, monitor frequency and progress, create replacement plans, earn achievements, share progress, and view analytical reports over time.

This project is part of a multi-week development plan:
- **Week 1:** Core setup, authentication, habit models  
- **Week 2:** Logging system & replacement plans  
- **Week 3:** Reports, dashboard, achievements, and social activity sharing

##  Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **Django** | Backend framework for building scalable web applications |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | Simplifies creation of RESTful APIs |
| **SimpleJWT** | Secure authentication with JSON Web Tokens |
| **SQLite/PostgreSQL** | Database for storing user and habit data |
| **Python 3.12+** | Primary language used for development |
| **VS Code** | Development environment |

## Why These Technologies

- **Django** provides robust ORM, admin interface, and scalability.  
- **DRF** simplifies API serialization and permission handling.  
- **JWT Authentication** ensures stateless, secure user sessions.  
- **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite for dev) offers reliability and ACID compliance.  
- **Python** allows quick development and clean, maintainable code.
